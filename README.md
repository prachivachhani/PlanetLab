This project is an attempt to carry out Internet Path Ananlysis. Planet-Lab is a global research network that helps in developing future network services. This project takes 10 nodes into the consideration to make 10 pairs (to carry out analysis like symmetricity). Among all the links between these pairs, few are inter-continental and few are intra-continental. Python Daemon scripts are executed on the main server to fetch all the ping and the trace data accross the links and the data is then saved automatically to the server. The data is used in the analysis like the number of hop counts, Reliability, Outages, Packetlosses, Latency etc with the help of Python Scripts. The results could help us predict the properties of network paths, in designing the realtime routing protocol to recreate or migrate state stored in the routers and provide better routing facility to the desired path.
